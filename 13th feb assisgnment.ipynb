    "ans:- Using the Exception class as the base class for creating custom exceptions in programming languages like Python is a common practice for several important reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency and Compatibility: In most programming languages, including Python, there is a hierarchy of exception classes. The Exception class typically serves as the base class for all exceptions. When you create a custom exception by inheriting from the Exception class, you ensure that your custom exception is consistent with the existing exception hierarchy. This consistency is crucial because it allows you to handle both built-in and custom exceptions in a consistent manner in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: In object-oriented programming, polymorphism allows you to treat objects of derived classes as objects of their base class. By inheriting from the Exception class, your custom exception can be treated as an exception just like any other built-in exception. This makes it easier to catch and handle your custom exceptions alongside standard exceptions using a common except block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clarity and Documentation: Using the Exception class as the base class for your custom exceptions makes your code more self-explanatory and understandable. When other developers read your code, they can immediately recognize that your custom exception is an exception class, making the code more maintainable and easier to document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interoperability: If you're developing a library or module that others may use, it's important to ensure that your custom exceptions can seamlessly integrate with other code. By following the convention of inheriting from the Exception class, you ensure that your exceptions can be caught and handled by users of your code without any surprises.\n",
    "\n",
    "Built-in Exception Handling: Most programming languages provide built-in mechanisms for handling exceptions. When you inherit from the Exception class, your custom exceptions can take advantage of these built-in features, such as try-except blocks, without any additional configuration.\n",
    "\n"
